# Python Fundamentals

Welcome to the Python Fundamentals repository!

This repository is designed to be your starting point and a basic reference for learning the absolute essentials (the ABCs) of Python programming. Whether you're just beginning your coding journey or need a quick refresher on the basics, this collection of simple examples covers fundamental concepts to get you started.

Think of this as your foundational toolkit for building Python projects.

## What's Inside?

This repository contains simple, clear examples demonstrating core Python concepts, such as:

* **Variables and Data Types:** Understanding how to store and work with different types of information (like numbers, text, lists, dictionaries).
* **Operators:** Learning how to perform operations on data (arithmetic, comparison, logical).
* **Control Flow:** Directing the flow of your program using conditional statements (`if`, `elif`, `else`) and loops (`for`, `while`).
* **Functions:** Writing reusable blocks of code.
* **Basic Input/Output:** Interacting with the user and printing information.
* *(You can add more specific topics here as you add files to your repo, e.g., "Working with Strings," "Lists and Tuples," etc.)*

Each example is kept simple and focused on demonstrating one or two key ideas.

## Getting Started

To use this repository, you'll need Python installed on your computer. If you don't have it, you can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/metenis/python-fundamentals.git](https://github.com/metenis/python-fundamentals.git)
    ```
    *(This command downloads the repository content to your local machine)*

2.  **Navigate into the repository directory:**
    ```bash
    cd python-fundamentals
    ```

3.  **Run any of the example files:**
    You can execute any Python file (`.py`) using the Python interpreter. For example:
    ```bash
    python filename.py
    ```
    *(Replace `filename.py` with the name of the file you want to run)*

Feel free to explore the code, modify it, and experiment to deepen your understanding.
